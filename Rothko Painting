            <!-- In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
            Imagine you receive a box from your favourite online retailer --
            the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element. -->
            <!-- <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png"> -->

            <!-- The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how
            bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
            Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in. -->

            <!-- Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxed or elements.
            Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page. -->
